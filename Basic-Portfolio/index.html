			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<img src="assets/images/KhalCali2.jpeg" alt="KhalCali2" style="width:180px;height:124px">

			<p>David recently graduated from the University of Illinois in May of 2015. He majored in community health, but his passion really lies at the intersection between music, technology, and community outreach. He has been an avid supporter of the Chicago Bulls, Cubs, and Flaming Hot Cheetos since his early days growing up in the city.</p>

			<p>In September of 2015, David relocated to San Diego, CA, and soon after, his quest for knowledge hit new heights. In the recent past, David has become keenly interested in web development and hopes to make a difference for the community by increasing the accessibility of unique sounds and good vibes for individuals of all ages.</p>
